\section{Introduction}

How to write proofs in \Idris{} in various different ways. Assumes you've read
the main tutorial~\cite{idris-tutorial}.

We'll be using interactive features. Since we have to pick one, we'll
use the Vim mode, but all of the interactive commands have a directly
corresponding command in emacs (and hopefully other editors eventually).
Perhaps an Appendix will list the correspondences.

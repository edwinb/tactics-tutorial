# Contributing to 'The Idris Tutorial'

## Rules

* Please aim to make commits self contained. Ideally one thing at a time.
* GitHub pull requests only. It might sound harsh but in future we aim to look at leveraging travis to provide CI testing of the tutorial.
* Campfire Rules, try and leave the files you work on in a better state than when you found them.
* We do not store binary builds of the tutorial here.

## Grammar and Spelling

* Before submitting try to run your contribution through: [Style-Check.rb](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nspring/software/style-check-readme.html). Style-Check.rb is a simple tool to check for _bad phrases_, and nominal _bad LaTeX_. The output is given in compiler format. 
* Version of English used...this has yet to be decided upon.

## Dev Process

For developing the tutorial, we aim to follow the following [Git Branching Model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model).
In this model there are two main branches:

* **master** Reflects the _current_ version of the tutorial inline with the _current_ version of Idris on Hackage.
* **dev** Reflects the latest upstream and current state of the tutorial.

All pull requests that are for new additions to the project should go to **dev**
All pull requests that detail fixes to the tutorial that is: grammar, spelling, and coding mistakes should be submitted to **master**

This might sound complicated but in the long term it makes sense in terms of release management.

## idrislang.sty

`idrislang.sty` is used to type set `idris` code within the tutorials.
To keep things `DRY` this style file has been *hard* linked with the original kept in `idris-dev`.
Normally, this file should live in the your local texmf tree, but if we want auto-generation of PDFs then the style file needs to be distributed alongside...

## Building

The tutorial is written in `LaTeX` and the build tool `latexmk` will be used to manage the compilation process.
`latexmk` comes with the default texlive installation.
A nominal `Makefile` is provided that abstracts over the use of `latexmk`.
`Emacs` with `AucTeX-mode` is used during writing.
The `auto` generated by `AucTeX` should be taken care of with the `.gitignore`.
Ditto goes with those pesky `.DS_Store` files generated by Mac OS X.
However, do not be surprised to see several `AucTeX` related code in `LaTeX` comments at the bottom of several files.

Useful bash aliases for working with LaTeXmk instead of a Makefile are:

    alias latexBuild='latexmk -gg -pdf -pvc -bibtex'
    alias latexQBuild='latexmk -gg -pdf -bibtex'
    alias latexClean='latexmk -c'
    alias latexClobber='latexmk -C'
